The argument over whether billionaires should pay more in taxes usually gets stuck in two ruts: moral outrage and logistical defeatism. One side says it is unfair, the other says it is impossible, and nothing changes because the tax system makes the fight self-canceling.

If you want a system that treats everyone consistently, billionaire to blue-collar, you do not start by arguing over income tax rates. You start by changing what we consider taxable capacity and when it becomes taxable.

Why raising income taxes on billionaires misses the target
Raising income tax rates assumes billionaires "earn" their wealth like most people do. Many do not. Their wealth is mostly held in assets that grow in value: stock, equity, real estate, and other holdings. That growth is often unrealized, meaning it is not taxed until the asset is sold.

This is not a loophole in the casual sense. It is a design choice. The system treats asset appreciation as theoretical until a sale, even though it can still be used as real power.

So without income, how do you tax the rich?
There are a few options, but the obvious one comes with a catch.

You could tax unrealized gains or net worth directly. The immediate objection is liquidity: plenty of Americans are asset rich on paper but cash poor in reality. Think family farms with valuable land and equipment. A tax that triggers purely on paper value can force sales or borrowing just to pay the bill. That concern is real, and it is why wealth taxes and estate taxes are politically toxic.

But that does not mean the status quo is fair. It means the problem is framed wrong.

The real problem is how we tax work vs wealth
Work is taxed immediately and automatically. Wealth is taxed conditionally. That conditionality is what creates safe zones where economic power grows untaxed unless and until someone chooses to realize it.

In practice, that means the people who can least avoid taxes pay them most reliably, while the people with the most economic leverage can choose the timing and structure of their tax exposure.

If the goal is fairness, the fix is not simply "raise the billionaire income tax rate." The fix is to rethink timing: tax economic power when it becomes usable, not only when it gets sold, and stop treating wages as the default piggy bank.

Flip the default
What if we flipped the default? What if work was taxed more conditionally, with more earnings protected up front, while large concentrations of wealth faced an annual tax based on capacity, not just realized sales?

This immediately raises the familiar objection: the asset rich, cash poor problem. Family farms and small businesses can hold valuable land or equipment without having spare cash to pay an annual wealth bill. Any serious proposal has to address that.

But this is not a dealbreaker. We already carve out targeted treatment all over the tax code, and we subsidize farming directly. If policymakers can design exclusions and relief for industries they want to protect, they can design liquidity safeguards for genuinely illiquid, working assets while still taxing concentrated financial wealth.

The second objection is philosophical: "How do you tax something that has not been realized?" In a framework that taxes wealth as capacity, not as a transaction, that objection stops being decisive. The current system treats appreciation as imaginary until a sale, yet treats it as real the moment it can be leveraged.

Because that is the quiet truth: unrealized gains are economically real enough to buy things.

In 2022, Elon Musk used the value of his holdings as collateral to secure financing for the purchase of Twitter without first needing to fully liquidate the underlying assets. That is the core contradiction. The tax system calls appreciation "unrealized" when obligation is due, but banks treat it as spendable power when opportunity appears.

If wealth can be converted into purchasing power on demand, then the claim that it is too theoretical to tax is less economics than convenient storytelling. Meanwhile, wages are taxed automatically, because people who live on wages cannot negotiate with the tax code.

That is why raising billionaire income tax rates misses the point. Our system taxes work on sight and taxes wealth only when it chooses to show up.
